## Support

I hope to keep the mod up-to-date, but I made the mod in a couple of days for my own use and I'm pretty busy and I tend to hop between projects often. However, anyone is free to update or expand on the mod if they want. I will not be making a Forge version, but others are welcome to.

## Future Plans
*None of these are guarantees, just thoughts I have*

- Update the mod to 1.20 when it comes out and add crafting recipes for the bamboo and cherry clapboards that are currently only available in creative.

- Include a bundled Programmer Art resource pack for those that prefer it, or are going for an alpha or beta feel with mods like Nostalgia Tweaks, Modern Beta, and Golden Days.

- Move the mod off of the MCreator platform.

- More localizations.

## Localizations

The mod has localizations available for the following languages:

- American English
- British English
- Australian English
- New Zealand/Aotearoa English
- Mexican Spanish
- Toki Pona
