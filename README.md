**Clapboards** is a client and server mod for the Fabric and Quilt mod loaders that adds several kinds of wooden clapboards. The mod comes with a bundled resourcepack with textures in line with Minecraft's pre-1.14/pre-Jappa textures, also known as Programmer Art.

## Mod Compat

- **[Condensed Creative](https://modrinth.com/mod/condensed-creative)**  
If Condensed Creative is present, all clapboard variants will be collapsed into a single group.

## Is that it?

Yep, that's it. I find that block mods tend to have so much overlap that if you install more than one -- which is likely because they also have unique blocks -- you'll end up with a ton of overlap that clutters your creative inventory, stonecutter, or worse, creates conflicting crafting recipes. While I'm not aware of any other mod that adds clapboards, I made Clapboards a single-feature mod because I think that's how these things generally ought to be done. It adds clapboards, and that's all it will ever do. If I want to add another block, that'll be a new mod. Maybe, if I get to more than maybe 8 mods, I'll consider combining them, but I'll have to carefully consider options to mitigate overlap.

## Support

I hope to keep the mod up-to-date, but I made the mod in a couple of days for my own use and I'm pretty busy and I tend to hop between projects often. However, anyone is free to update or expand on the mod if they want. I will not be making a Forge version, but others are welcome to.

## Future Plans
*None of these are guarantees, just thoughts I have*

- Update the mod to 1.20.

- More localizations.

- Mod compat. Don't know what mods yet. File a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/pastellexists/clapboards/issues) and let me know what compat you'd like to see, maybe?

- Maybe, *maybe* add other Painted Clapboards in the various dye colors? I'm apprehensive because it's basically a slightly different version of Dyed Planks, a concept to which I am personally averse, but on the other hand, it seems weird to have a recipe using a dye that can't also use all the dyes.

## Localizations

The mod has localizations available for the following languages:

- American English
- British English
